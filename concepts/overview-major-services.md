# Major services and features in Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph enables you to integrate with the best of Office 365, Windows 10, and enterprise mobility and security services in Microsoft 365. Additionally, you can leverage social and security intelligence to boost user productivity, creativity, and team collaboration, and to protect business resources and users' data. 

Some services in Microsoft Graph make their debut there, others have been well-known as standalone services and are now converging in Microsoft Graph. Their API sets follow a streamlined design as detailed in the [Microsoft REST API guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines), and are now accessible through the single Microsoft Graph REST endpoint `https://graph.microsoft.com`. The major services and features are listed below by category.
