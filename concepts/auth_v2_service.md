# Get access without a signed-in user
Service and daemon apps run on a server without the presence of a signed-in user. An example of such an app might be an email archival service that wakes up and runs overnight. Service apps typically use the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow to get an access token from Azure AD. In this topic, we will walk through the basic steps to configure a service app and use the OAuth Client Credentials Grant flow to get an access token from Azure AD to call Microsoft Graph. 

## Authentication and Authorization steps
The basic steps required to authenticate a service and get a token from the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint to make calls to Microsoft Graph are:

1. Register your app.
2. Configure permissions for Microsoft Graph.
3. Get administrator consent.
4. Get an access token.
5. Use the access token to call Microsoft Graph.

## 1. Register your app
To authenticate with the Azure v2.0 endpoint, you must register your app at the [Microsoft App Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/). You can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account to register an app. 

The following screenshot shows a Web app registration that has been configured for a service app.
![Service app registration](./images/v2-service-registration.png)

For a service, you need to register your app for the Web platform and copy the following values:

- The Application Id assigned by the app registration portal.
- An Application Secret, either a password or a public/private key pair (certificate).
- A Redirect URL for your service to receive token responses from Azure AD.
- A Redirect URL for your service to receive admin consent responses if your app implements functionality to request administrator consent.  

For steps on how to configure an app using the Microsoft App Registration Portal, see [Register your app](./auth_register_app_v2.md).

With the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow, your app authenticates directly at the Azure AD v2.0 `/token` endpoint using the Application Id  assigned by Azure AD and the Application Secret that you create using the portal. 

## 2. Configure permissions for Microsoft Graph
For apps that run without a signed-in user, Microsoft Graph exposes Application permissions. Application permissions always require administrator consent. You pre-configure these permissions when you register your app. An administrator can either consent to these permissions using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) when your app is installed in their organization, or you can provide a sign-up experience in your app through which administrators can consent to the permissions that your app requires. Once administrator consent is recorded by Azure AD, your app can request tokens without having to request consent again. For more detailed information about the permissions available with Microsoft Graph, see the [Permissions reference](./permissions_reference.md)

To configure Application permissions for your app in the Microsoft App Registration portal: under **Microsoft Graph**, choose **Add** next to **Application Permissions** and then select the permissions your app requires in the **Select Permissions** dialog.

The following screenshot shows the  **Select Permissions** dialog for Microsoft Graph Application permissions. 

![Select Permissions dialog for Microsoft Graph Application permissions.](./images/v2-application-permissions.png)

> **Important**: We recommend configuring the least privileged set of permissions required by your app. This provides a much more comfortable experience for administrators than having to consent to a long list of permissions.

## 3. Get administrator consent
You can rely on an administrator to grant the permissions your app needs at the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com); however, often, a better option is to provide a sign-up experience for administrators by using the Azure AD v2.0 `/adminconsent` endpoint. 

### Request
```
// Line breaks are for legibility only.

GET https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/adminconsent?
client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&state=12345
&redirect_uri=http://localhost/myapp/permissions
```

| Parameter | Condition | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tenant |Required |The directory tenant that you want to request permission from. This can be in GUID or friendly name format. If you don't know which tenant the user belongs to and you want to let them sign in with any tenant, use `common`. |
| client_id |Required |The Application ID that the [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) assigned to your app. |
| redirect_uri |Required |The redirect URI where you want the response to be sent for your app to handle. It must exactly match one of the redirect URIs that you registered in the portal, except that it must be URL encoded, and it can have additional path segments. |
| state |Recommended |A value that is included in the request that also is returned in the token response. It can be a string of any content that you want. The state is used to encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on. |

### Consent experience
Azure AD enforces that only a tenant administrator can sign in to complete the request. The administrator will be asked to approve all the direct application permissions that you have requested for your app in the app registration portal. The following is an example of the consent dialog that Azure AD presents to the administrator:

![Administrator consent dialog.](./images/admin-consent.png)

### Response
If the administrator approves the permissions for your application, the successful response looks like this:

```
GET http://localhost/myapp/permissions?tenant=a8990e1f-ff32-408a-9f8e-78d3b9139b95&state=state=12345&admin_consent=True
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| tenant |The directory tenant that granted your application the permissions that it requested, in GUID format. |
| state |A value that is included in the request that also is returned in the token response. It can be a string of any content that you want. The state is used to encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on. |
| admin_consent |Set to **true**. |


> **Try** You can try this for yourself by pasting the request below in a browser. If you sign in as a Global administrator for an Azure AD tenant, you will be presented with the administrator consent dialog for the app. (This will be a different app than that in the consent dialog screenshot shown above.)
> 

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e&state=12345&redirect_uri=http://localhost/myapp/permissions
```

## 4. Get an access token
In the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow, you use the client id and a client secret to request an access token directly from the Azure AD v2.0 `/token` endpoint. These are the Application Id and Application Secret values that you saved when you configured your app in the App Registration Portal.

You specify the pre-configured permissions by passing `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` as the value for the `scope` parameter in the token request. See the `scope` parameter description in the token request below for details.

### Token request
You send a POST request to the `/token` v2.0 endpoint to acquire an access token:

```
POST /{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1
Host: login.microsoftonline.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=535fb089-9ff3-47b6-9bfb-4f1264799865&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default&client_secret=qWgdYAmab0YSkuL1qKv5bPX&grant_type=client_credentials
```

| Parameter | Condition | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tenant |Required |The directory tenant that you want to request permission from. This can be in GUID or friendly name format. |
| client_id |Required |The Application ID that the [Microsoft App Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com) assigned when you registered your app. |
| scope |Required |The value passed for the `scope` parameter in this request should be the resource identifier (Application ID URI) of the resource you want, affixed with the `.default` suffix. For Microsoft Graph, the value is `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default`. This value informs the v2.0 endpoint that of all the direct application permissions you have configured for your app, it should issue a token for the ones associated with the resource you want to use. |
| client_secret |Required |The Application Secret that you generated for your app in the app registration portal. |
| grant_type |Required |Must be `client_credentials`. |

#### Token response
A successful response looks like this:

```
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik1uQ19WWmNBVGZNNXBP..."
}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| access_token |The requested access token. Your app can use this token in calls to Microsoft Graph. |
| token_type |Indicates the token type value. The only type that Azure AD supports is `bearer`. |
| expires_in |How long the access token is valid (in seconds). |

## 5. Use the access token to call Microsoft Graph

Once you have an access token, you can use it to call Microsoft Graph by including it in the `Authorization` header of a request. The following request gets the profile of a specific user. Your app must have the _User.Read.All_ permission to call this API.

```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/user/12345678-73a6-4952-a53a-e9916737ff7f 
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiO ... 0X2tnSQLEANnSPHY0gKcgw
Host: graph.microsoft.com

```
A successful response will look similar to this (some response headers have been removed):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

## Supported app scenarios and resources
Service apps run on a server without the presence of a signed-in user. Service apps use the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant to authenticate with Azure AD and get a token. 

For more information about the Client Credentials Grant flow that also includes error, see [Azure Active Directory v2.0 and the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-client-creds). 

For a sample that calls Microsoft Graph from a service, see the [v2.0 daemon sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon-v2) on GitHub.

Rather than implement code at the protocol level, most developers will use an authentication library to handle details of authentication and authorization with Azure AD. Using an authentication library abstracts many the details of protocol implementation, token and response validation, token caching and refresh, following best practice security measures during protocol interactions, etc. away from the developer, and lets you concentrate your development efforts on the functionality of your app. Microsoft publishes the open-source Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for acquiring tokens from Azure AD v2.0. For use with Web apps, Microsoft also publishes open-source OWIN middleware libraries that support OpenID Connect and middleware libraries that secure sessions with cookies. Currently MSAL is in general availability for .NET and MSAL libraries for iOS, Android, and JavaScript are in preview. 

For more information about recommended Microsoft and third-party authentication libraries and server middleware for Azure AD v2.0, see [Azure Active Directory v2.0 authentication libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-libraries).

## Azure AD endpoint considerations
If you are using the Azure AD endpoint, there are some differences in the way that you configure your app and the way that it signs in to Azure AD:

- You use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to configure your app. For more information about configuring apps with the Azure portal, see [Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory: Adding an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications#adding-an-application)
- There is no admin consent endpoint (`/adminconsent`), instead, your app can request administrator consent during runtime by adding the `prompt=admin_consent` parameter to an authorization request. For more information, see **Triggering the Azure AD consent framework at runtime** in [Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications).
- The parameters in authorization and token requests are different. For example, there is no `scope` parameter in Azure AD endpoint requests; instead, the `resource` parameter is used to specify the URI of the resource (`resource=https://graph.microsoft.com`) that authorization (for administrator consent) or a token is being requested for.

For a detailed example of the Client Credentials Grant flow with the Azure AD endpoint, see [Service to service calls using client credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-service-to-service).

For the Azure AD endpoint, you can use the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) to get tokens from Azure AD. ADAL is available for several platforms including .NET, iOS, Android, JavaScript, Java, and Node.js. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Authentication Libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-libraries).
