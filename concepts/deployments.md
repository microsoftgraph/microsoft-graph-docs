# National cloud deployments

In addition to our global network of datacenters, Microsoft cloud services are available in three separate national clouds. These national cloud versions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Microsoft enterprise cloud services that are confined within the geographic borders of specific countries and operated by local personnel.

Current national clouds include:

- Microsoft Cloud for US Government
- Microsoft Cloud Germany
- Azure and Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China

Each national cloud environment is unique and different than the Microsoft global environment. It is important to be aware of some of these key differences when you develop applications for national cloud environments; for example, registering applications, acquiring tokens, and calling the Microsoft Graph API can be different.

This article provides information about the different Microsoft Graph national cloud deployments and the capabilities that are available to developers within each.

>**Note:** [Microsoft Graph data connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/data-connect-concept-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) does not support any of the national cloud deployments.

## App registration and token service root endpoints

Before calling the Microsoft Graph APIs, you should first register your application and acquire a token. The following table lists the base URLs for the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) endpoints to register your application and acquire tokens for each national cloud.

| National cloud | Azure AD portal endpoint| Azure AD endpoint|
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|
|Azure AD for US Government |https://portal.azure.us|`https://login.microsoftonline.us`|
|Azure AD Germany |https://portal.microsoftazure.de|`https://login.microsoftonline.de`|
|Azure AD China operated by 21Vianet |https://portal.azure.cn|`https://login.chinacloudapi.cn`|
|Azure AD (global service)|https://portal.azure.com |`https://login.microsoftonline.com`|

To learn more about Azure AD access tokens and Microsoft Graph, see [authentication basics](./auth/auth-concepts.md). For Azure AD authentication scenarios, see [Azure AD authentication basics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios).


## Microsoft Graph and Graph Explorer service root endpoints

The following table shows the service root endpoints for Microsoft Graph and [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) for each national cloud.

| National Cloud | Microsoft Graph | Graph Explorer |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Microsoft Graph for US Government L4 | https://graph.microsoft.us | Not supported. |
| Microsoft Graph for US Government L5 (DOD) | https://dod-graph.microsoft.us | Not supported. |
| Microsoft Graph Germany | https://graph.microsoft.de | Not supported. |
| Microsoft Graph China operated by 21Vianet | https://microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn | https://developer.microsoft.com/zh-cn/graph/graph-explorer-china |
| Microsoft Graph global service | https://graph.microsoft.com | https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer |

>**Important:** If you already have an app in US Government and you're using the worldwide endpoint `https://graph.microsoft.com`, we recommend switching to the new `https://graph.microsoft.us` endpoint. Access to US Government data using worldwide endpoint is currently functional but will be disabled in near future.

> **Note**: Apps can only access organizational data through the national cloud endpoints. This means that apps can only access data in tenants that are registered in the specific national cloud. Apps that are trying to access consumer data associated with Microsoft personal accounts through Microsoft Graph should use the global service `https://graph.microsoft.com`. Access tokens acquired for a national cloud deployment are not interchangeable with those acquired for the global service or any other national cloud.

## Supported features

The following Microsoft Graph features are generally available on the `/v1.0` endpoint across all national cloud deployments, except where noted.

(*) Limited support for Exchange and OneDrive services only. Azure AD services are not supported. 

 > **IMPORTANT:** Certain services and features that are in specific regions of the global service might not be available in all of the national clouds. To find out what services are available, see [products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=all&regions=usgov-non-regional,us-dod-central,us-dod-east,usgov-arizona,usgov-iowa,usgov-texas,usgov-virginia,china-non-regional,china-east,china-east-2,china-north,china-north-2,germany-non-regional,germany-central,germany-northeast).
