# National cloud deployments


In addition to our global network of datacenters, Microsoft cloud services are available in three separate national clouds. These national cloud versions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Microsoft enterprise cloud services, which are confined within the geographic borders of specific countries and operated by local personnel. To learn more, see [Microsoft National Clouds](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/NationalCloud).

Current national clouds include:

- Microsoft Cloud for US Government
- Microsoft Cloud Germany
- Azure and Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China

This article provides information about the different national cloud deployments of Microsoft Graph and the capabilities within each deployment that are available to developers.

## Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Graph Explorer service root endpoints

The following table shows the service root endpoints for Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Graph Explorer for each National cloud.

| National Cloud | Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Graph Explorer
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Microsoft Graph China operated by 21Vianet | https://microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn | https://developer.microsoft.com/zh-cn/graph/graph-explorer-china |
| Microsoft Graph Germany | https://graph.microsoft.de | Not supported. |
| Microsoft Graph for US Government | https://graph.microsoft.com | Not supported. |
| Microsoft Graph global service | https://graph.microsoft.com | https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer |

> **Note**: Apps can only access organizational data through the national cloud endpoints. This means that only data in tenants registered in the specific national cloud can be accessed. Apps that are trying to access consumer data associated with personal Microsoft accounts through Microsoft Graph should use the global service (https://graph.microsoft.com). Access tokens acquired for a national cloud deployment are not interchangeable with those acquired for the global service.

## Azure AD OpenID Connect and OAuth2.0 endpoints

The following table lists the base URLs for the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) endpoints used to acquire tokens to call Microsoft Graph for each national cloud.

| National Cloud | Azure AD root endpoint |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Azure AD China operated by 21Vianet |https://login.chinacloudapi.cn |
| Azure AD Germany | https://login.microsoftonline.de |
| Azure AD for US Government | https://login.microsoftonline.us |
| Azure AD (global service) | https://login.microsoftonline.com |

Requests to the Azure AD authorization or token endpoints can be formed using the appropriate region-specific base URL. For example, for Germany:

- The authorization common endpoint is https://login.microsoftonline.de/common/oauth2/authorize.
- The token common endpoint is https://login.microsoftonline.de/common/oauth2/token.

Tenant-specific endpoints can be formed by replacing "common" in the URLs above with either the tenant ID or a verified domain for the tenant.
Whether you use the common or tenant-specific endpoints will depend upon the requirements of your app and the authentication flow you are using to get tokens. To learn more about Azure AD access tokens and Microsoft Graph, see [Get auth tokens](./auth_overview.md).

> **Note:** The [Azure AD v2.0 authorization and token endpoints](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-appmodel-v2-overview/) are available on the global service only; they are not yet supported for use with national cloud deployments.
