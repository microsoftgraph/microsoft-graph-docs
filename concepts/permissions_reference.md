## Overview
Microsoft Graph exposes granular permissions that control the access that apps have to resources like users, groups, and mail and to the APIs that operate on them like sending mail on behalf of a user or reading and writing a user's profile. As a developer, you decide which permissions for Microsoft Graph your app requests. When a user signs in to your app they, or, in some cases, an administrator, are given a chance to consent to these permissions. If the user consents, your app is given access to the resources and APIs that it has requested. For apps that don't take a signed-in user, permissions can be pre-consented to by an administrator when the app is installed or during sign-up. 

### Delegated permissions, Application permissions, and effective permissions
Microsoft Graph has two types of permissions: **Delegated permissions** and **Application permissions**. 

- **Delegated permissions** are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests and the app is delegated permission to act as the signed-in user when making calls to Microsoft Graph. Some Delegated permissions can be consented to by non-administrative users, but some higher-privileged permissions require administrator consent.  

- **Application permissions** are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present; for example, apps that run as background services or daemons.  Application permissions can only be consented by an administrator. 

_Effective permissions_ are the permissions that your app will have when making requests to Microsoft Graph. It is important to understand the difference between the Delegated and Application permissions that your app is granted and its effective permissions when making calls to Microsoft Graph.

- For Delegated permissions, the _effective permissions_ of your app will be the least privileged intersection of the Delegated permissions the app has been granted (via consent) and the privileges of the currently signed-in user. Your app can never have more privileges than the signed-in user. Within organizations, the privileges of the signed-in user may be determined by policy or membership in one or more administrator roles. For more information about administrator roles, see [Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles).
   
  For example, assume your app has been granted the _User.ReadWrite.All_ Delegated permission. This permission nominally grants your app permission to read and update the profile of every user in an organization. If the signed-in user is a global administrator, your app will be able to update the profile of every user in the organization. However, if the signed-in user is not in an administrator role, your app will be able to update only the profile of the signed-in user. It will not be able to update the profiles of other users in the organization because the user that it has permission to act on behalf of does not have those privileges.
- For Application permissions, the _effective permissions_ of your app will be the full level of privileges implied by the permission. For example, an app that has the _User.ReadWrite.All_ Application permission can update the profile of every user in the organization. 

### Microsoft Graph permission names
Microsoft Graph permission names follow a simple pattern: _resource.operation.constraint_. For example, _User.Read_ grants permission to read the profile of the signed-in user, _User.ReadWrite_ grants permission to read and modify the profile of the signed-in user, and _Mail.Send_ grants permission to send mail on behalf of the signed-in user. 

The _constraint_ element of the name determines the potential extent of access your app will have within the directory. Currently Microsoft Graph supports the following constraints: 

* **All** grants permission for the app to perform the operations on all of the resources of the specified type in a directory. For example, _User.Read.All_ potentially grants the app privileges to read the profiles of all of the users in a directory. 
* **Shared** grants permission for the app to perform the operations on resources that other users have shared with the signed-in user. This constraint is mainly used with Outlook resources like mail, calendars, and contacts. For example, _Mail.Read.Shared_, grants privileges to read mail in the mailbox of the signed-in user as well as mail in mailboxes that other users in the organization have shared with the signed-in user.
* **AppFolder** grants permission for the app to read and write files in a dedicated folder in OneDrive. This constraint is only exposed on [Files permissions](#files-permissions) and is only valid for Microsoft accounts.
* If **no constraint** is specified the app is limited to performing the operations on the resources owned by the signed-in user. For example, _User.Read_ grants privileges to read the profile of the signed-in user only, and _Mail.Read_ grants permission to read only mail in the mailbox of the signed-in user.

> **Note**: In delegated scenarios, the effective permissions granted to your app may be constrained by the privileges of the signed-in user in the organization.
> 

### Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts

Not all permissions are valid for both Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts. You can check **Remarks** for each permission group to determine whether a specific permission is valid for Microsoft accounts, work or school accounts, or both. 

### User and group search limitations for guest users in organizations

User and group search capabilities allow the app to search for any user or group in an organization's directory by performing queries against the `/users` or `/groups` resource set (for example, `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users`). Both administrators and users have this capability; however, guest users do not. If the signed-in user is a guest user, depending on the permissions an app has been granted, it can read the profile of a specific user or group (for example, `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/241f22af-f634-44c0-9a15-c8cd2cea5531`); however, it cannot perform queries against the `/users` or `/groups` resource set that potentially return more than a single resource. With the appropriate permissions, the app cam read the profiles of users or groups that it obtains by following links in navigation properties; for example, `/users/{id}/directReports` or `/groups/{id}/members`.

 Directory permissions provide the highest level of privilege for accessing directory resources such as [User](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/user.md), [Group](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/group.md), and [Device](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/device.md) in an organization. They also exclusively control access to other directory resources like: [organizational contacts](../api-reference/beta/resources/orgcontact.md), [schema extension APIs](../api-reference/beta/resources/schemaextension.md), [Privileged Identity Management (PIM) APIs](../api-reference/beta/resources/privilegedidentitymanagement_root.md), as well as many of the resources and APIs listed under the **Directory** node in the v1.0 and beta API reference documentation. These include administrative units, directory roles, directory settings, policy, and many more. 

The _Directory.ReadWrite.All_ permission grants the following privileges:

- Full read of all directory resources (both declared properties and navigation properties)
- Create and update users
- Disable and enable users (but not company administrator)
- Set user alternative security id (but not administrators)
- Create and update groups
- Manage group memberships
- Update group owner
- Manage license assignments
- Define schema extensions on applications

### Remarks

#### Support for permissions in preview
**Delegated permissions**: 

- _Files.Read.Selected_ and _Files.ReadWrite.Selected_ are not yet supported by Microsoft Graph. For backward compatibility these permissions can be configured and included in authorization requests, but no privileges are granted by Microsoft Graph. Support for these permissions is planned in the future. 
- Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder_ is supported on Microsoft accounts only. 

**Application permissions**: 

- _Files.Read.All_ and _Files.ReadWrite.All_ are currently not fully supported by Microsoft Graph; however, some privileges are granted with these permissions. Full support is planned soon. 


### Example usage
#### Delegated

* _Files.Read_ : Read files stored in the signed-in user's OneDrive (`GET /me/drive/root/children`)
* _Files.Read.All_ : Read files shared with the signed-in user (`GET /me/drive/root/sharedWithMe`)
* _Files.ReadWrite_ : Write a file in the signed-in user's OneDrive (`PUT /me/drive/root/children/filename.txt/content`)
* _Files.ReadWrite.All_ : Write a file shared with the user (`PUT /users/rgregg@contoso.com/drive/root/children/file.txt/content`)
* _Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder_ : Write files into the app's folder in OneDrive (`PUT /me/drive/special/approot/children/file.txt/content`)

## Group permissions

#### Delegated permissions

|   Permission    |  Display String   |  Description | Admin Consent Required |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| _Group.Read.All_ |    Read all groups | Allows the app to list groups, and to read their properties and all group memberships on behalf of the signed-in user.  Also allows the app to read calendar, conversations, files, and other group content for all groups the signed-in user can access. | Yes |
| _Group.ReadWrite.All_ |    Read and write all groups| Allows the app to create groups and read all group properties and memberships on behalf of the signed-in user.  Additionally allows group owners to manage their groups and allows group members to update group content. | Yes |

#### Application permissions

|   Permission    |  Display String   |  Description | Admin Consent Required |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| _Group.Read.All_ | Read all groups | Allows the app to read memberships for all groups without a signed-in user. Note that not all group API supports access using app-only permissions. See [known issues](../overview/release_notes.md) for examples. | Yes |
| _Group.ReadWrite.All_ | Read and write all groups | Allows the app to create groups, read and update group memberships, and delete groups. All of these operations can be performed by the app without a signed-in user. Note that not all group API supports access using app-only permissions. See [known issues](../overview/release_notes.md) for examples.| Yes |


### Remarks

Group functionality is not supported on Microsoft accounts. 

For Office 365 groups, Group permissions grant the app access to the contents of the group; for example, conversations, files, notes, and so on. Group permissions are also used to control access to [Office 365 Planner](../api-reference/beta/resources/planner_overview.md) resources and APIs.

For Application permissions, there are some limitations for the APIs that are supported. For more information, see [known issues](../overview/release_notes.md).

In some cases, an app may need [Directory permissions](#directory-permissions) to read some group properties like `member` and `memberOf`. For example, if a group has a one or more [servicePrincipals](../api-reference/beta/resources/serviceprincipal.md) as members, the app will need effective permissions to read service principals through being granted one of the _Directory.\*_ permissions, otherwise Microsoft Graph will return an error. (In the case of Delegated permissions, the signed-in user will also need sufficient privileges in the organization to read service principals.) The same guidance applies for the `memberOf` property, which can return [administrativeUnits](../api-reference/beta/resources/administrativeunit.md).

### Example usage
#### Delegated

* _Group.Read.All_ : Read all Office 365 groups that the signed-in user is a member of (`GET /me/memberOf/$/microsoft.graph.group?$filter=groupTypes/any(a:a%20eq%20'unified')`).
* _Group.Read.All_ : Read all Office 365 group content like conversations (`GET /groups/{id}/conversations`).
* _Group.ReadWrite.All_ : Update group properties, like photo (`PUT /groups/{id}/photo/$value`).
* _Group.ReadWrite.All_ : Update group members (`POST /groups/{id}/members/$ref`). NOTE: This also requires _User.ReadBasic.All_ to read the user to add as a member.

#### Application

* _Group.Read.All_ : Find all groups with name that starts with 'Sales' (`GET /groups?$filter=startswith(displayName,'Sales')`).
* _Group.ReadWrite.All_ : Daemon service creates new events on an Office 365 group's calendar (`POST /groups/{id}/events`).

### Remarks

The only permissions valid for Microsoft accounts are _User.Read_ and _User.ReadWrite_. For work or school accounts, all permissions are valid.

With the _User.Read_ permission, an app can also read the basic company information of the signed-in user for a work or school account through the [organization](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/organization.md) resource. The following properties are available: id, displayName, and verifiedDomains.

For work or school accounts, the full profile includes all of the declared properties of the [User](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/user.md) resource. On reads, only a limited number of properties are returned by default. To read properties that are not in the default set, use `$select`. The default properties are:

- displayName
- givenName
- jobTitle
- mail
- mobilePhone
- officeLocation
- preferredLanguage
- surname
- userPrincipalName

 _User.ReadWrite_ and _User.Readwrite.All_ Delegated permissions allow the app to update the following profile properties for work or school accounts:

- aboutMe
- birthday
- hireDate
- interests
- mobilePhone
- mySite
- pastProjects
- photo
- preferredName
- responsibilities
- schools
- skills

With the _User.ReadWrite.All_ Application permission, the app can update all of the declared properties of work or school accounts except for password.

To read or write direct reports (`directReports`) or the manager (`manager`) of a work or school account, the app must have either _User.Read.All_ (read only) or _User.ReadWrite.All_.

The _User.ReadBasic.All_ permission constrains app access to a limited set of properties known as the basic profile. This is because the full profile might contain sensitive directory information. The basic profile includes only the following properties: 

- displayName
- givenName
- mail
- photo
- surname
- userPrincipalName


To read the group memberships of a user (`memberOf`), the app must have either [_Group.Read.All_](#group-permissions) or [_Group.ReadWrite.All_](#group-permissions). However, if the user also has membership in a [directoryRole](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/directoryrole.md) or an [administrativeUnit](../api-reference/beta/resources/administrativeunit.md), the app will need effective permissions to read those resources too, or Microsoft Graph will return an error. This means the app will also need [Directory permissions](#directory-permissions), and, for Delegated permissions, the signed-in user will also need sufficient privileges in the organization to access directory roles and administrative units. 

### Example usage
#### Delegated

* _User.Read_ : Read the full profile for the signed-in user (`GET /me`).
* _User.ReadWrite_ : Update the photo of the signed-in user (`PUT /me/photo/$value`).
* _User.ReadBasic.All_ : Find all users whose name starts with "David" (`GET /users?$filter=startswith(displayName,'David')`).
* _User.Read.All_ : Read a user's manager (`GET /user/{id | userPrincipalName}/manager`).


#### Application

* _User.Read.All_ : Read all users and relationships through delta query (`GET /beta/users/delta?$select=displayName,givenName,surname`).
* _User.ReadWrite.All_ : Update the photo for any user in the organization (`PUT /user/{id | userPrincipalName}/photo/$value`).

## Permission scenarios

This section shows some common scenarios that target [user](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/user.md) and [group](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/group.md) resources in an organization. The tables show the permissions that an app needs to be able to perform specific operations required by the scenario. Note that in some cases the ability of the app to perform some operations will depend on whether a permission is an Application or Delegated permission. In the case of Delegated permissions, the app's effective permissions will also depend on the privileges of the signed-in user within the organization. For more information on Application permissions and Delegated permissions and an app's effective permissions, see [Overview](#overview).
