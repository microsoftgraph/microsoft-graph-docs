# Microsoft Teams API overview (preview)

Microsoft Teams is the ultimate hub for teamwork and intelligent communications. Built on the strength and scale of Office 365 with over 120 million users, Microsoft Teams delivers chat-based collaboration, meetings, calling, and enterprise voice features.

## Why integrate with Microsoft Teams?

Integrating with Microsoft Teams makes it easy for you to build your own services and apps, reaching millions of enterprise users and helping people get work done together. You can use Microsoft Graph to create and manage teams, channels, messages, and more.

### Use Microsoft Graph in any kind of app

Microsoft Teams apps built on Microsoft Graph give work groups a new tool to make collaboration a more productive and compelling experience. Using Microsoft Teams, work group users share assets, interact through chat, and schedule events on the team calendar. Enhance the value of Microsoft Teams by adding team, channel, and conversation automation via apps based on the Microsoft Teams API.

Websites, services, and native platform applications are not run within the Microsoft Teams user experience but can be used to call the Microsoft Teams APIs that enable Microsoft Teams automation scenarios.

**Types of apps enabled for Microsoft Teams**

These collaboration tools include Microsoft Graph-enabled tabs or bots running inside Microsoft Teams apps. You can also call Microsoft Graph outside of a Microsoft Teams app, such as from a website or a web service. If you've already enabled your website for Microsoft Graph, you can use that work for Microsoft Teams by using the [Microsoft Teams developer platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/#pivot=home&panel=home-all) to [create a tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/tabs/tabs-overview) that uses the existing website code.

Microsoft Teams APIs can enhance apps inside and outside of Teams:

|App type|Scenario description|
|:-------|:-------------------|
|Tabs|Surface enhanced content within Microsoft Teams.|
|Connectors|Post updates from external services to channels.|
|Actionable messaging|Add enhanced interaction to your connector cards.|
|Websites|Surface enhanced content in your web pages.|
|Bots|Help users get tasks done in conversations.|
|Activity feed|Engage users via feed notifications.|
|Messaging extensions|Allow users to query and share information in conversations.|
|Services|Enhance your client applications with Microsoft Graph data via your web service.|
|Calling and online meetings|Create Microsoft Teams apps with bots that can initiate and participate in audio/video calls, route/transfer calls based on interactive voice response (IVR) flows, and participate in online meetings.|

### Create multiple teams and channels

Allow your customers to create new [teams](../api-reference/beta/resources/team.md) and [channels](../api-reference/beta/resources/channel.md) linked to your app. Make creating large numbers of teams and populating them with users and channels easy by using the Microsoft Teams API.

### Automate team lifecycles

Use Microsoft Graph to create a new virtual team when a new business issue arises, [populate the team](../api-reference/v1.0/api/group_post_members.md) with the right people, and configure the team with channels. To start a team channel discussion around the new business issue, you can seed the channel with a new conversation thread to post a welcome message to new team members. If you want to get the new team together to discuss the business issue, add a new event to the team calendar and then invite the members of the team to the event.

When the business issue is resolved and you no longer need the virtual team, use the Microsoft Teams API to tear down the team. If you know the maximum duration of the virtual team when you create it, set an [Office 365 group expiration policy](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/office-365-group-expiration-policy-8d253fe5-0e09-4b3c-8b5e-f48def064733?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) for the team that automatically removes the team according to the policy.
