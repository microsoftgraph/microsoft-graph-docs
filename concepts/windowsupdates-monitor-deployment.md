# Monitor a deployment by the Windows Update for Business deployment service

To monitor the progress of a Windows Update for Business deployment service deployment, Microsoft recommends using [Update Compliance](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/update-compliance-get-started). In Update Compliance, you can view per-device update deployment status as well as device and update issues that need attention.
