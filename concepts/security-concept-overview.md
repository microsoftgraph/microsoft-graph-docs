# Microsoft Graph Security API overview

You can use the Microsoft Graph Security API to connect Microsoft security products, services, and partners to streamline security operations and improve threat protection, detection, and response capabilities. The Microsoft Graph Security API is an intermediary service (or broker) that provides a single programmatic interface to connect multiple [Microsoft Graph Security providers](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/securityvendorinformation.md) (also called security providers or providers). Requests to the Microsoft Graph Security API are federated to all applicable security providers. The results are aggregated and returned to the requesting application in a common schema, as shown in the following diagram. For details, see [Microsoft Graph Security data flow](security-dataflow.md).

For information about authorization, see [Authorization and the security API](security-authorization.md). For information about permissions, including delegated and application permissions, see [Permissions](permissions_reference.md#security-permissions).

## Why use the Microsoft Graph Security API?

The [Microsoft Graph Security API](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/security-api-overview.md) makes it easy to connect with different Microsoft and Microsoft partner security products and services. It allows you to more readily realize and enrich the value of these solutions.

### Unify and standardize alert tracking

Write code once to integrate alerts from any Microsoft Graph-integrated security solution and keep alert status and assignments in sync across all solutions. You can also stream alerts to security information and event management (SIEM) solutions, such as Splunk and IBM QRadar, via [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitor-stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs#what-can-i-do-with-the-monitoring-data-being-sent-to-my-event-hub). For details about SIEM integration with the security API entities, see [Integrate with a SIEM](security_siemintegration.md).

### Correlate security alerts to improve threat protection and response

Correlate alerts across security solutions more easily with a unified alert schema. This not only allows you to receive actionable alert information but allows security analysts to pivot and enrich alerts with asset and user information, enabling faster response to threats and asset protection.  

### Update alert tags, status, and assignments

Tag alerts with additional context or threat intelligence to inform response and remediation. Ensure that comments and feedback on alerts are captured for visibility to all workflows. Keep alert status and assignments in sync so that all integrated solutions reflect the current state. Use webhook subscriptions to get notified of changes.  

### Unlock security context to drive investigation

Dive deep into related security-relevant inventory (like users, hosts, and apps), then add organizational context from other Microsoft Graph providers (Azure AD, Microsoft Intune, Office 365) to bring business and security contexts together and improve threat response.

### Proactively manage security risks (preview)

Use the Microsoft Secure Score (preview) to provide visibility into your organizationâ€™s security needs and get suggestions for how to improve it, and project an improved score after those suggestions are incorporated. Easily measure your progress over time and get insights on specific changes that led to improvement in your score.
