# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## May 2021: New in preview only

### Education
- Teacher can now select to add assignment on teachers and students calendars when publishing the assignment, teachers can control the assignment calendar behavior by using the **addToCalendarAction** property of the [educationAssignment](/graph/api/resources/educationAssignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource.
- Teacher can now also select a default calendars behavior when publishing assignments in the future, teachers can control the assignment default calendar behavior by using the **addToCalendarAction** property of the [educationAssignmentDefaults](/graph/api/resources/educationAssignmentDefaults?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource.
- Graph users (Teacher) can now trigger the assignment level resources folder creation before uploading assignment resources on OneDrive, teachers can trigger the assignment resources folder creation by using the **SetUpResourcesFolder** function on the [educationAssignment](/graph/api/resources/educationAssignment-SetupResourcesFolder?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource. The save is made available on educationAssignment through the property **resourcesFolderUrl**
- Graph users (Students) can now trigger the submission level resources folder creation before uploading a OneDrive resource for a given submission, student can trigger the submission resources folder creation by using the **SetUpResourcesFolder** function on the [educationSubmission](/graph/api/resources/educationSubmission-SetupResourcesFolder?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource. The save is made available on educationAssignment through the property **resourcesFolderUrl**
## April 2021: New and generally available

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
- Manage an [authentication policy](/graph/api/resources/authenticationflowspolicy) at a tenant level, to enable or disable [self-service sign-up](/graph/api/resources/selfservicesignupauthenticationflowconfiguration) of external users.
- Administrators can associate user flows with apps that are shared with external users and enable [self-service sign-up](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/self-service-sign-up-overview) on those apps. They can customize a self-service sign-up user flow and create a personalized sign-up experience. Once an application is associated with the user flow, users who go to that application will be able to initiate a sign-up flow that provisions a guest account.
- Configure [user flow attributes](/graph/api/resources/identityuserflowattribute) in your Azure AD tenant allows you to collect information about a user during sign-up. You can collect a built-in set of attributes, or configure custom user flow attributes to collect information from a user that is not built in to the directory. 
- In an [Azure Active Directory user flow](/graph/api/resources/b2xidentityuserflow), you can manage language defaults and [customize the language and strings displayed to users in the user flow](/graph/api/resources/userflowlanguageconfiguration).
- Use an [API connector](/graph/api/resources/identityapiconnector) in user flows for Azure AD self-service sign-up and Azure AD B2C sign-up, to call an API at a specific step to affect the execution of the user flow.

### Teamwork
- Identify the channel by the **channelIdentity** property, if a [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage) is within a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel).
- Identify the chat by the **chatId** property, if the **[chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage)** is in a [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat).
- Use the **messages** relationship to get all the [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage) resources in a [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat).
- Use application permissions to [get](/graph/api/chat-get) the properties of a specified [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat).
- Use application permissions to [get a specified chat member](/graph/api/chat-get-members) or [get all the chat members](/graph/api/chat-list-members) included in a chat. Because data for users as chat members is sensitive, other than obtaining application permissions, please [request additional access](teams-protected-apis.md) to these operations.

### Use the Toolkit
New to the [Microsoft Graph Toolkit](/graph/toolkit/overview)? Try the new [Toolkit learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/m365-msgraph-toolkit/?WT.mc_id=m365-19989-cxa), use the Toolkit set of web components and authentication providers to connect a web app to Microsoft Graph, and load data from Microsoft 365.

- Deep link into an [educationAssignment](/graph/api/resources/educationAssignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) through the **webUrl** property.

### Identity and access | Governance
Administrators can [get](/graph/api/accessreviewpolicy-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [update](/graph/api/accessreviewpolicy-update?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) policies at the directory-level to review access, by using the [accessReviewPolicy](/graph/api/resources/accessreviewpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource. For example, administrators can use an access review policy to enable or disable group owners reviewing access on groups that they own.

### Search

- [Get](/graph/api/teamsappicon-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) the properties of an [icon](/graph/api/resources/teamsAppIcon?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) associated with a Teams app. To get the actual image of the icon, use [get hosted content](/graph/api/teamworkhostedcontent-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Use SDKs
- Try the [preview release of the Microsoft Graph JavaScript client library, version 3.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client/v/3.0.0-Preview.1).This release enables multiple authentication flows, server-side authentication, Node.js Stream large file upload and progress tracking, and more.

### Identity and access | Governance
- Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) [consent requests](/graph/api/resources/consentrequests-root) to manage the request workflow for users attempting to access apps that require admin approval. The API makes use of the following resources:
  - The [adminConsentRequestPolicy](/graph/api/resources/adminconsentrequestpolicy) resource for creating and managing requests for app access for the organization.
  - The [appConsentRequest](/graph/api/resources/appconsentrequest) resource for aggregating and managing user requests to access a specific app.

Authentication methods policies that can be managed in Microsoft Graph include [FIDO2 security keys](/graph/api/resources/fido2authenticationmethodconfiguration), Passwordless Phone Sign-in with [Microsoft Authenticator app](/graph/api/resources/microsoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethodconfiguration), and tenant's [email OTP authentication methods policy](/graph/api/resources/emailauthenticationmethodconfiguration).
- GA of [feature rollout policy](/graph/api/resources/featureRolloutPolicy) that helps tenant administrators to pilot features to specific groups before enabling them for the entire organization.
- GA of the [organization branding properties](/graph/api/resources/organizationalbrandingproperties) which enables a custom look and feel of Azure Active Directory sign-in screens. Organizations can customize based on locale for specific users.

  - [Send notification to user in a chat](/graph/api/chat-sendactivitynotification)
  - [Send notification to user in a team](/graph/api/team-sendactivitynotification)
  - [Send notification to user](/graph/api/userteamwork-sendactivitynotification)
- Migrate users' message history and data from an external system into a Teams channel, allowing users to continue their communications seamlessly. Use the following methods that support the migration scenario:
  - [Create team](/graph/api/team-post)
  - [Create channel](/graph/api/channel-post)
