# Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps

To authenticate your applications using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you need to register them in Azure AD. This is where Office 365 user account and application information is stored. To manage Azure AD through the Azure portal, you need a Microsoft Azure subscription. You can use the portal in Microsoft Azure to manage users, roles, and apps. 

This article shows you how to associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps.

 >**Note:** This article uses Azure AD as the authentication provider for your app. If you're using the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint, you don't need to perform this step. For more information, see [App authentication with Microsoft Graph](auth_overview.md).

## Prerequisites

**Office 365 for business account**

If you don't have an existing Office 365 for business account, you can:

- Sign up for an [Office 365 for business plans](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans) listed above, or
- [Join the Office 365 Developer Program and get a free 1 year subscription to Office 365](https://aka.ms/devprogramsignup).

**Microsoft Azure subscription** 

- If you can have an existing Microsoft Azure subscription, you can associate your Office 365 for business subscription with it. 

- Otherwise, you'll need to create a new Azure subscription and associate it with your Office 365 account in order to register and manage apps.
