# Use the Microsoft Search API in Microsoft Graph to search messages

You can use the Microsoft Search API to search for information in email messages, return messages ranked by relevance, and render a dedicated search experience. The search applies to the body and attachments of messages in the user's own mailbox.

[!INCLUDE [search-api-preview-signup](../includes/search-api-preview-signup.md)]

A search query can include [filters](https://support.office.com/article/learn-to-narrow-your-search-criteria-for-better-searches-in-outlook-d824d1e9-a255-4c8a-8553-276fb895a8da) that end users enter in the **Search** text box in Outlook.

Message search results are sorted by **receivedDateTime** in descending order.

Message search applies to work or school accounts. Users can search their own mailbox, but can't search delegated mailboxes. For details, see [known limitations](#known-limitations).

Message search also looks for attachments. The [supported file types](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/technical-reference/default-crawled-file-name-extensions-and-parsed-file-types) for message attachment search are the same as those for SharePoint Online search.

## Examples

### Example 1: Search messages in a user's mailbox

The following example queries messages in the signed-in user's mailbox that contain the string "contoso" in any part of the message (the sender name, subject, message body, or any attachments). The query returns the first 25 results. The search results are ordered by **DateTime** descending.

#### Request

```HTTP
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/search/query
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "requests": [
    {
      "entityTypes": [
        "microsoft.graph.message"
      ],
      "query": {
        "query_string": {
          "query": "contoso"
        }
      },
      "from": 0,
      "size": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response, which contains one message that matches the search criterion.

                  }
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Request

```HTTP
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/search/query
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "requests": [
    {
      "entityTypes": [
        "microsoft.graph.message"
      ],
      "query": {
        "query_string": {
          "query": "contoso"
        }
      },
      "from": 0,
      "size": 15,
      "enableTopResults": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Known limitations

- You can only access a userâ€™s own mailbox. Searching delegated mailboxes is not supported.
- For messages, the **total** property of the [searchHitsContainer](/graph/api/resources/searchhitscontainer?view=graph-rest-beta) type contains the number of results on the page, not the total number of matching results.
