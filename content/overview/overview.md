# Overview of Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph exposes multiple APIs from Office 365 and other Microsoft cloud services through a single endpoint:  **https://graph.microsoft.com**. Microsoft Graph simplifies queries that would otherwise be more complex. 
 
You can use Microsoft Graph to:

- Access data from multiple Microsoft cloud services, including Azure Active Directory, Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, OneNote, and Planner.
- Navigate between entities and relationships.
- Access intelligence and insights from the Microsoft cloud (for commercial users).

##Common Microsoft Graph queries

Microsoft Graph exposes two endpoints: /v1.0 and /beta. The /v1.0 endpoint includes the resources that you can access in your production app. The [/beta](../../api-reference/beta/beta-overview.md) endpoint includes APIs that are currently in preview. The following table lists some common queries that you can use to access the Microsoft Graph API.

| **Operation**	| **Service endpoint** |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
|   GET my profile |	`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me` |
