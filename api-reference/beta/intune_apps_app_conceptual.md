Managing apps involves tasks such as:
##  Add
You can use Intune to deploy apps to a wide variety of devices that you manage. The first step in app deployment is to add the apps, which you want to manage and deploy, to Intune. While you can work with many different app types, the basic procedures are the same.
For more details, see [How to add and deploy apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836754).
## Deploy
You deploy apps to get the apps on the devices that you manage.  After adding apps, you then deploy it to users. For more details, see [How to add and deploy apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836754).

##  Configure

* A custom port number.
* Language settings.

# Protect
Microsoft Intune app protection policies help protect your company data and prevent data loss.

You can use Intune app protection policies to help protect your company’s data. Because Intune app protection policies can be used independent of any mobile-device management (MDM) solution, you can use it to protect your company’s data with or without enrolling devices in a device management solution. By implementing app-level policies, you can restrict access to company resources and keep data within the purview of your IT department.

For more details see [What is Microsoft Intune app protection policy?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=837538).
# Retire
You can wipe apps and data from I devices that are no longer needed, are being repurposed, or have gone missing. To do this, Intune provides selective wipe and full wipe capabilities. Users can also issue a remote device wipe command from the Intune Company Portal app on privately owned devices enrolled in Intune.
