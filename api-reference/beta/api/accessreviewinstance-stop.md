# Stop accessReviewInstance

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Stop a currently active [accessReviewInstance](../resources/accessreviewinstance.md). To prevent a recurring access review from starting future instances, [update it](accessreviewscheduledefinition-update.md) to change its scheduled end date.  After the access review stops, reviewers can no longer give input, and the access review decisions can be applied.
