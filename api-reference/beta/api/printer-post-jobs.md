# Create printJob for a printer

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [printJob](../resources/printJob.md) for a [printer](../resources/printer.md). 

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

In addition to the following permissions, the user or app's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription and have a permission that grants [Get printer](printer-get.md) access. The signed in user must be a [Printer Administrator](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#printer-administrator).

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)| PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic, PrintJob.ReadWrite, PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic.All, PrintJob.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not Supported.|
|Application| Not Supported. |

## HTTP request

```http
POST print/printers/{id}/jobs
```

## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type  | application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [printJob](../resources/printjob.md) object. The printJob object should only contain **configuration**. All properties of **configuration** are nullable. All other fields, including job and document IDs, are set automatically during resource creation.

Right now, Universal Print supports only one **printDocument** per **printJob** object.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [printJob](../resources/printjob.md) object and associated [printDocument](../resources/printDocument.md) in the response body.
