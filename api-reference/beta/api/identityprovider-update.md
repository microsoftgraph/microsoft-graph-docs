|Property|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|clientId|String|The client ID for the application. This is the client ID obtained when registering the application with the identity provider.|

|name|String|The display name of the identity provider.|
|type|String|The identity provider type.<ul>For B2B scenario:<li/>Google<li/>Facebook</ul><ul>For B2C scenario:<li/>Microsoft<li/>Google<li/>Amazon<li/>LinkedIn<li/>Facebook<li/>GitHub<li/>Twitter<li/>Weibo<li/>QQ<li/>WeChat<li/>OpenIDConnect</ul>|

### openIdConnectProvider object

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|clientId|String|The client ID for the application. This is the client ID obtained when registering the application with the identity provider.|
|clientSecret|String|The client secret for the application. This is the client secret obtained when registering the application with the identity provider.|
|name|String|The display name of the identity provider.|
|type|String|The identity provider type. The value must be `OpenIdConnect`.|
|claimsMapping|[claimsMapping](../resources/claimsmapping.md)|After the OIDC provider sends an ID token back to Azure AD, Azure AD needs to be able to map the claims from the received token to the claims that Azure AD recognizes and uses. This complex type captures that mapping.|
|domainHint|String|The domain hint can be used to skip directly to the sign in page of the specified identity provider, instead of having the user make a selection among the list of available identity providers.|
|metadataUrl|String|The URL for the metadata document of the Open Id Connect identity provider.|
|responseMode|String|Defines the method that should be used to send the data back from the custom identity provider to Azure AD B2C. The following response modes can be used: <ul><li/>`form_post` : This response mode is recommended for best security. The response is transmitted via the HTTP POST method, with the code or token being encoded in the body using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.<li/>`query` : The code or token is returned as a query parameter.</ul>|
|responseType|String|Describes what kind of information is sent back in the initial call to the authorization_endpoint of the custom identity provider. The following response types can be used:<ul><li/> `code` : As per the authorization code flow, a code will be returned back to Azure AD B2C. Azure AD B2C proceeds to call the token_endpoint to exchange the code for the token.<li/> `id_token` : An ID token is returned back to Azure AD B2C from the custom identity provider. <li/>`token` : An access token is returned back to Azure AD B2C from the custom identity provider. (This value is not supported by Azure AD B2C at the moment)</ul>|
|scope|String|Scope defines the information and permissions you are looking to gather from your custom identity provider.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. If unsuccessful, a `4xx` error will be returned with specific details.
