For best performance,  don't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|appliedCategories|[plannerAppliedCategories](../resources/plannerappliedcategories.md)|The categories to which the task has been applied. See [applied Categories](../resources/plannerappliedcategories.md) for possible values.|
|assigneePriority|String|Hint used to order items of this type in a list view. The format is defined as outlined [here](../resources/planner-order-hint-format.md).|
|assignments|[plannerAssignments](../resources/plannerassignments.md)|The set of users the task is assigned to.|
|bucketId|String|Bucket id to which the task belongs. The bucket needs to be in the plan that the task is in. It is 28 characters long and case-sensitive. [Format validation](../resources/tasks-identifiers-disclaimer.md) is done on the service. |
|conversationThreadId|String|Thread id of the conversation on the task. This is the id of the conversation thread object created in the group.|
|dueDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Date and time at which the task is due. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: `'2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'`|
|orderHint|String|Hint used to order items of this type in a list view. The format is defined as outlined [here](../resources/planner-order-hint-format.md).|
|percentComplete|Int32|Percentage of task completion. When set to `100`, the task is considered completed. |
|priority|Int32|Priority of the task. Valid range of values is between `0` and `10` (inclusive), with increasing value being lower priority (`0` has the highest priority and `10` has the lowest priority).  Currently, Planner interprets values `0` and `1` as "urgent", `2` and `3` and `4` as "important", `5`, `6`, and `7` as "medium", and `8`, `9`, and `10` as "low".  Currently, Planner sets the value `1` for "urgent", `3` for "important", `5` for "medium", and `9` for "low".|
|startDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Date and time at which the task starts. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: `'2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'`|
|title|String|Title of the task.|
