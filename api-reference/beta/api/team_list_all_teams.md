# List all teams

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Retrieves all [groups](../resources/group.md) in the organization (tenant) that have corresponding [teams](../resources/team.md). 
Any group that has a team has a resourceProvisioningOptions property that contains "Team", 
so the approach is to get a [list of all groups](group_list.md) where resourceProvisioningOptions contains "Team".

See [list of all groups](group_list.md) for information on permissions and responses.

Note: Teams that were deleted then restored may not be included, Microsoft is working to address this limitation.

Note: The Group.resourceProvisioningOptions can be changed.
Do not add or remove "Team" from that collection, 
otherwise list all teams will return incorrect results.

## Example
