## Examples

### Example 1: Create a bundle

The following example shows how to create a basic new bundle.
This request will create a new bundle named `Just some files` and add two existing items to the bundle.
This bundle can be used to share a collection of files with other users without sharing the folder those items are stored in.

#### Request

The response object shown here might be shortened for readability. All the properties will be returned from an actual call.

### Example 2: Create an album

The request to create a new photo album is similar, although inside the bundle facet, the album property is set to a non-null value.

#### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "create-album" } -->

```json
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drive/bundles
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "My Day at the Beach",
  "@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior" : "rename",
  "bundle": { "album": {} },
  "children": [
    { "id": "1234asdf" }
  ]
}
```

#### Response

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem", "truncated": true } -->

```json
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "1234321!abc",
  "name": "Just some files",
  "bundle": {
    "childCount": 2,
    "album": { }
 }
}
```

If _@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior_ is set to **rename** and a bundle with the same name already exists, the new bundle name will be updated to be unique.
OneDrive will append a number to the end of the bundle name.

For example, `My Day at the Beach` would be renamed `My Day at the Beach 1`.
If `My Day at the Beach 1` is taken, then the number would be incremented again until a unique bundle name is discovered.
