# Create invitation

Use this API to create a new [invitation](../resources/invitation.md). Invitation adds an external user to the organization.

When creating a new invitation you have several options available:
1. On invitation creation, Microsoft Graph can automatically send an invitation email directly to the invited user, or your app can use the *inviteRedeemUrl* returned in the creation response to craft your own invitation (through your communication mechanism of choice) to the invited user. If you decide to have Microsoft Graph send an invitation email automatically, you can control the content and language of the email using [*invitedUserMessageInfo*](../resources/invitedusermessageinfo.md).
2. When the user is invited, a user entity (of userType Guest) is created and can now be used to control access to resources. Additionally, if a group is specified in the *invitedToGroups* property during creation, then on redemption that invited user will also be added as a member of the specified group. The invited user has to go through redemption process to access any resources he has been invited to.

### Prerequisites
