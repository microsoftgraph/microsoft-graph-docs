# Create b2cUserFlow

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)| Not supported.|
|Application|IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All|

The work or school account needs to belong to one of the following roles:

* Global administrator
* External Identity User Flow administrator

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /identity/b2cUserFlows
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON representation of a [b2cUserFlow](../resources/b2cuserflows.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|id|String|Required. The name of the user flow. The name will be pre-pended with `B2C_1` after creation.|
|userFlowType|String|Required. The type of user flow you are creating. The supported values for **userFlowType** are:<br/><ul><li>`signUp`</li><li>`signIn`</li><li>`signUpOrSignIn`</li><li>`passwordReset`</li><li>`profileUpdate`</li><li>`resourceOwnerPasswordCredentialSignIn`</li>|
|userFlowTypeVersion|Float|Required. The version of the user flow.|
|identityProviders|[identityProvider](../resources/identityprovider.md) collection|Optional. The identity providers you want to include in the user flow.|
|b2cAuthenticationMethods|String|Used to configure which local accounts are allowed for sign-up/sign-in. The supported values are:<br/><ul><li>`emailWithPassword`</li><li>`userName`</li><li>`phoneWithOneTimePassword`</li></ul>The service allows only certain combinations of `phoneWithOneTimePassword`, `emailWithPassword`, and `userName` to be enabled based on user journey type and other conditions. A v1 or v2 user flow allows one of either the `emailWithPassword` or `userName` methods to authenticate, and it does not allow the `phoneWithOneTimePassword` method. By default, this value will align with the b2cAuthenticationMethod enabled for the tenant. If only one b2cAuthenticationMethod is enabled, that is the default value; otherwise, `emailWithPassword` is the default authentication method.|


## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a Location header with a URI to the [b2cUserFlow](../resources/b2cuserflows.md) object created for this request, with the `B2C_1` prefix added to the name. If unsuccessful, a `4xx` error will be returned with specific details.
