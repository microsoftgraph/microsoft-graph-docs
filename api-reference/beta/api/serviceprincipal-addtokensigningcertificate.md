# servicePrincipal: addTokenSigningCertificate

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Creates a self-signed signing certificate and returns a [selfSignedCertificate](../resources/selfsignedcertificate.md), which is the public part of the generated certificate. The self-signed signing certificate is composed of these resources: the private key ([keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) with usage = 'Sign'), the public key ([keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) with usage = 'verify'), and the [passwordCredential](../resources/passwordcredential.md). All the created resources have the same **customKeyIdentifier**.

The **passwordCredential** is used to open the pfx/private key. Also, it's associated with the privateKey having the same **keyId**. The subject of the certificate is a constant value. It won't be affected by the optional **displayName** provided in the POST call. The **startDateTime** is set to the same time the certificate is created using the action. The **endDateTime** can be up to three years after the certificate is created.
