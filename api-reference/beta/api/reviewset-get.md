## Permissions

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /compliance/ediscovery/cases/{id}/reviewSets/{id}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports some of the OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

By default, all review set fields are returned; however, you can specify certain fields to return using the OData `$select` query parameter.  For example, to only return the **displayName** and ID, add the following to your query: `$select=displayName,Id`.

Because a request can return many cases, you can filter them by using **displayName**.  To filter by **displayName**, add the following to your query: `$filter=displayName eq 'rs1'`, where the review set name is rs1.

For more information about filtering and specifying fields, see [Using Filter Expressions in OData URIs
](/dynamics-nav/using-filter-expressions-in-odata-uris).

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and the requested [reviewSet](../resources/reviewset.md) object in the response body.
