> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Represents an Identity Experience Framework Policy (also called custom policy) in Azure Active Directory B2C.  An Identity Experience Framework Policy gives you full control over the identity workflow.  Creating one enables:

* Control of each step in the user journey through the identity stack.
* Federation to any SAML, Open ID Connect, or OAuth2 identity provider.
* Integration with other systems or user data stores by calling REST endpoints.
* Transformation of claims and customization of tokens issued to the relying party application.
