# Get mailFolder

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a message folder object.

There are two scenarios where an app can get another user's mail folder:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a mail folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](../../../concepts/outlook-share-messages-folders.md).


## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite |
