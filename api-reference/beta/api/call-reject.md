# call: reject

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Enables the bot to reject an incoming [call](../resources/call.md). The incoming call request can be an invite to a meeting or a peer to peer call. The incoming call request times out after 15 seconds. If no response is sent during this time, the call is automatically rejected.

Once the bot is registered with a valid callback URL in the Azure portal, the incoming call is delivered as a [commsNotification](../resources/commsnotification.md) with `changeType` set to `created`. The bot is expected to `Answer` or `Reject` the call before it times out.

> **Note:** This API is only used to reject incoming calls. To terminate existing calls, [Delete Call](../api/call-delete.md) should be used instead.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
