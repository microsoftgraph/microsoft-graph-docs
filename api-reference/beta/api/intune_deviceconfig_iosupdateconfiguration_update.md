## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation for the [iosUpdateConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_iosupdateconfiguration.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [iosUpdateConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_iosupdateconfiguration.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|Key of the entity. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|supportsScopeTags|Boolean|Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|isEnabled|Boolean|Is setting enabled in UI|
|activeHoursStart|TimeOfDay|Active Hours Start (active hours mean the time window when updates install should not happen)|
|activeHoursEnd|TimeOfDay|Active Hours End (active hours mean the time window when updates install should not happen)|
|scheduledInstallDays|[dayOfWeek](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_dayofweek.md) collection|Days in week for which active hours are configured. This collection can contain a maximum of 7 elements. Possible values are: `sunday`, `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`.|
|utcTimeOffsetInMinutes|Int32|UTC Time Offset indicated in minutes|
|enforcedSoftwareUpdateDelayInDays|Int32|Days before software updates are visible to iOS devices ranging from 0 to 90 inclusive|
