# Get a user

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Retrieve the properties and relationships of user object.

Since the **user** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **user** instance.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
