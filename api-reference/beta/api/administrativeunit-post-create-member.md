# Add a member

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Use this API to create a new group within an administrative unit.

`NOTE: Currently it's only possible to create one group at a time in an administrative unit.`

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.Create, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /administrativeUnits/{id}/members/$ref
```
## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

The following table shows the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource to specify when you create a group in the Administrative Unit. 

| Property | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| displayName | string | The name to display in the address book for the group. Required. |
| description | string | A description for the group. Optional. |
| isAssignableToRole | Boolean | Set to **true** to enable the group to be assigned to an Azure AD role. Only Privileged Role Administrator and Global Administrator can set the value of this property. Optional. |
| mailEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for mail-enabled groups. Required. |
| mailNickname | string | The mail alias for the group. These characters cannot be used in the mailNickName: `@()\[]";:.<>,SPACE`. Required. |
| securityEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for security-enabled groups, including Microsoft 365 groups. Required. |
| owners | [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) collection | This property represents the owners for the group at creation time. Optional. |
| members | [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) collection | This property represents the members for the group at creation time. Optional. |
|visibility|String|Specifies the visibility of a Microsoft 365 group. Possible values are: `Private`, `Public`, `HiddenMembership`, or empty (which is interpreted as `Public`).|

> **Note:** Groups created using the Microsoft Azure portal always have **securityEnabled** initially set to `true`.

Because the **group** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the group while creating it.

>**Note:** Creating a group using the Group.Create application permission without specifying owners will create the group anonymously and the group will not be modifiable. You can use the `POST` operation and add owners to the group while creating it to specify owners who can modify the group.

> Creating a Microsoft 365 group programmatically with an app-only context and without specifying owners will create the group anonymously. Doing so can result in the associated SharePoint Online site not being created automatically until further manual action is taken.  

Specify other writable properties as necessary for your group. For more information, see the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource.

### groupTypes options

Use the **groupTypes** property to control the type of group and its membership, as shown.

| Type of group | Assigned membership | Dynamic membership |
|:--------------|:------------------------|:---------------|
| Microsoft 365 (aka unified group)| `["Unified"]` | `["Unified","DynamicMembership"]`
| Dynamic | `[]` (_null_) | `["DynamicMembership"]`|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [group](../resources/group.md) object in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of the group.
