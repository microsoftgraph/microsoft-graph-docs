## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /me/contacts/{id}
PATCH /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contacts/{id}
```
A [contact](../resources/contact.md) from a user's top level [contactFolder](../resources/contactfolder.md).

PATCH /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contactFolders/{id}/contacts/{id}
```

add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **contact** instance.
