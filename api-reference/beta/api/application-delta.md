# application: delta

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get newly created, updated, or deleted applications without having to perform a full read of the entire resource collection. See [Using Delta Query](/graph/delta-query-overview) for details.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

To begin tracking changes, you make a request including the delta function on the application resource. 

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /applications/delta
```

### Query parameters

Tracking changes incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. If you use any query parameter 
(other than `$deltatoken` and `$skiptoken`), you must specify 
it in the initial **delta** request. Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters 
into the token portion of the `nextLink` or `deltaLink` URL provided in the response. 
You only need to specify any desired query parameters once upfront. 
In subsequent requests, copy and apply the `nextLink` or `deltaLink` URL from the previous response, as that URL already 
includes the encoded, desired parameters.

| Query parameter	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| $deltatoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same resource collection, indicating the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `deltaLink` URL including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that collection.|
| $skiptoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating there are further changes to be tracked in the same resource collection. |

## Optional query parameters

This method supports OData Query Parameters to help customize the response.

- You can use a `$select` query parameter as in any GET request to specify only the properties your need for best performance. The 
_id_ property is always returned. 

- There is limited support for `$filter`:
  * The only supported `$filter` expression is for tracking changes for specific resources, by their id:  `$filter=id+eq+{value}` or `$filter=id+eq+{value1}+or+id+eq+{value2}`. The number of ids you can specify is limited by the maximum URL length.


## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer &lt;token&gt;|
| Content-Type  | application/json |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

### Response

If successful, this method returns `200 OK` response code and [application](../resources/application.md) collection object in the response body. The response also includes a nextLink URL or a deltaLink URL. 

- If a `nextLink` URL is returned, there are additional pages of data to be retrieved in the session. The application continues making requests using the `nextLink` URL until a `deltaLink` URL is included in the response.

- If a `deltaLink` URL is returned, there is no more data about the existing state of the resource to be returned. Persist and use the `deltaLink` URL to learn about changes to the resource in the future.
