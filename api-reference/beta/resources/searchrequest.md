# searchRequest resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [search-api-deprecation](../../includes/search-api-deprecation.md)]

A search request formatted in a JSON blob. 

The JSON blob contains the types of resources expected in the response, the underlying sources, paging parameters, sort options, requested aggregations and fields, and actual search query. See [examples](#see-also) of search requests on various resources.

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware of [known limitations](search-api-overview.md#known-limitations) on searching specific combinations of entity types, and sorting or aggregating search results.


## Properties

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|
|aggregations|[aggregationOption](aggregationOption.md) collection|Specifies aggregations (also known as refiners) to be returned alongside search results. Optional.|
|aggregationFilters|String collection|Contains one or more filters to obtain search results aggregated and filtered to a specific value of a field. Optional.<br>Build this filter based on a prior search that aggregates by the same field. From the response of the prior search, identify the [searchBucket](searchBucket.md) that filters results to the specific value of the field, use the string in its **aggregationFilterToken** property, and build an aggregation filter string in the format **"{field}:\\"{aggregationFilterToken}\\""**. <br>If multiple values for the same field need to be provided, use the strings in its **aggregationFilterToken** property and build an aggregation filter string in the format **"{field}:or(\\"{aggregationFilterToken1}\\",\\"{aggregationFilterToken2}\\")"**. <br>For example, searching and aggregating drive items by file type returns a **searchBucket** for the file type `docx` in the response. You can conveniently use the **aggregationFilterToken** returned for this **searchBucket** in a subsequent search query and filter matches down to drive items of the `docx` file type. [Example 1](/graph/search-concept-aggregation#example-1-request-aggregations-by-string-fields) and [example 2](/graph/search-concept-aggregation#example-2-apply-an-aggregation-filter-based-on-a-previous-request) show the actual requests and responses.|
|contentSources|String collection|Contains the connection to be targeted. <br>Respects the following format : `/external/connections/connectionid` where `connectionid` is the ConnectionId defined in the Connectors Administration. <br> Note: contentSource is only applicable when entityType=`externalItem`. Optional.|
|enableTopResults|Boolean|This triggers hybrid sort for messages: the first 3 messages are the most relevant. This property is only applicable to entityType=`message`. Optional.|
|entityTypes|entityType collection| One or more types of resources expected in the response. Possible values are: `list`, `site`, `listItem`, `message`, `event`, `drive`, `driveItem`, `externalItem`. See [known limitations](search-api-overview.md#known-limitations) for those combinations of two or more entity types that are supported in the same search request. Required.|
|fields|String collection |Contains the fields to be returned for each resource object specified in **entityTypes**, allowing customization of the fields returned by default otherwise, including additional fields such as custom managed properties from SharePoint and OneDrive, or custom fields in **externalItem** from content that Microsoft Graph connectors bring in. <br>The fields property can be using the [semantic labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-5-assign-property-labels) applied to properties. For example, if a property is label as title, you can retrieve it using the following syntax : label_title.<br>Optional.|
|from|Int32|Specifies the offset for the search results. Offset 0 returns the very first result. Optional.|
|query|[searchQuery](searchquery.md)|Contains the query terms. Required.|
|size|Int32|The size of the page to be retrieved. Optional.|
|sortProperties|[sortProperty](sortProperty.md) collection|Contains the ordered collection of fields and direction to sort results. There can be at most 5 sort properties in the collection. Optional.|
|stored_fields (deprecated)|String collection |This is now replaced by the **fields** property. |
