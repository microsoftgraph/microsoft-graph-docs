# b2cUserFlows resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a user flow within an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant.

To help you set up the most common identity tasks for your applications, Azure Active Directory B2C includes predefined, configurable policies called [user flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview). A user flow lets you determine how users interact with your application when they do things like sign in, sign up, edit a profile, or reset a password. You can create many user flows of different types in your tenant and use them in your applications as needed. With user flows, you can control the following capabilities:

- Account types used for sign-in, such as social accounts like a Facebook or local account
- Attributes to be collected from the consumer, such as first name, postal code, and shoe size
- Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
- Customization of the user interface
- Information that the application receives in the token

|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|[List user flows](../api/b2cuserflows-list.md)|b2cUserFlow collection|Retrieve all user flows.|
|[Get user flow](../api/b2cuserflows-get.md)|b2cUserFlow|Retrieve properties of a user flow.|
|[Create user flow](../api/b2cuserflow-post-b2cuserflows.md)|b2cUserFlow|Create a new user flow.|
|[Delete user flow](../api/b2cuserflows-delete.md)|None|Delete a user flow.|
|[List identity providers](../api/b2cuserflows-list-identityproviders.md)|[identityProvider](../resources/identityProvider.md) collection|Retrieve all identity providers in a user flow.|
|[Add identity provider](../api/b2cuserflows-update-identityprovider.md)|None|Add an identity provider to a user flow.|
|[Delete identity provider](../api/b2cuserflows-delete-identityprovider.md)|None|Delete an identity provider from a user flow.|

## Properties

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|id|String|The name of the user flow. This is a required value and is immutable after it's created. The name will be prefixed with the value of `B2C_1_` after creation.|
|userFlowType|String|The [type of user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-versions). The supported values for **userFlowType** are:<br/><ul><li>`signUp`</li><li>`signIn`</li><li>`signUpOrSignIn`</li><li>`passwordReset`</li><li>`profileUpdate`</li><li>`resourceOwnerPasswordCredentialSignIn`</li>|
|userFlowVersion|Single|The version of the user flow.|
|b2cAuthenticationMethods|Single|This property can be used to configure which local accounts are allowed for sign-up/sign-in. The supported values for **b2cAuthenticationMethods** are:<br/><ul><li>`emailWithPassword`</li><li>`userName`</li><li>`phoneWithOneTimePassword`</li>. The service allows only certain combinations of `phoneWithOneTimePassword`, `emailWithPassword` and `userName` to be enabled here based on user journey type and other conditions. A v1 or v2 user flow allows either one of `emailWithPassword` or `userName` methods to authenticate. And it does not allow `phoneWithOneTimePassword` method. By default this value will align with b2cAuthenticationMethod enabled for tenant. If only one b2cAuthenticationMethod is enabled, that is chosen here for default value else `emailWithPassword` is th default authentication method.|

## Relationships

| Relationship       | Type  |Description|
