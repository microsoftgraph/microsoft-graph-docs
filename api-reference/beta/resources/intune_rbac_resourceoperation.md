> **Important:** APIs under the / beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) by the customer.

This defines an operation or action that can be performed on an Intune resource (or entity).  Common operations are Read, Delete, Update or Create.  These operations provide basic management of the underlying Intune resource itself.  In some cases, an Intune resource can have operations that are used by the resource to take action in combination with other resources.  For example, the Assign operation is used to assign a MobileApp resource to an AAD security group.  Resource operations cannot be modified for built-in roles.This defines an operation or action that can be performed on an Intune resource (or entity).
