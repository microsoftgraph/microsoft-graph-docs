# team resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

A team in Microsoft Teams is a collection of [channels](channel.md). 
A channel represents a topic, and therefore a logical isolation of discussion, within a team.

Every team is associated with a [group](../resources/group.md).
The group has the same id as the team -- ie, /groups/{id}/team is the same as /teams/{id}.
