# governanceRoleAssignment resource type
> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Represents the assignment of a user or group to a role.

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) supports two types of assignments:

1. Active assignment - Represents the direct access to resources.
2. Eligible assignment - Represents an intermediate stage of privileged access to resources, between no access and direct access. Administrators can temporarily assign users/groups to `eligible assignment` in advance. Whenever the access is needed for users/group members, `activation` on the `eligible assignment` is needed to gain the instant access to the resource for several hours. After activation, an `active assignment` will be created for the users/group members to indicate the activated status.
