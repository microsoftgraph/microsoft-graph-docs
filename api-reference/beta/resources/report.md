## Using Graph permission scopes

Microsof Graph controls access to resources using permission scopes. As a developer, you must specify the permission scopes you need to access Reports resources. Typically, you specify the permission scopes you need in the Azure Active Directory portal. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph permission scopes](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference) and [Reports permission scopes](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference#reports-permissions).
