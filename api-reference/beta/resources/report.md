## Using Microsoft Graph permissions 

Microsof Graph controls access to resources via permissions. You must specify the permissions you need in order to access Reports resources. Typically, you specify permissions in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) portal. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference) and [Reports permissions](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference#reports-permissions).
