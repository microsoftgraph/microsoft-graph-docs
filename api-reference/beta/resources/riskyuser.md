# riskyUsers resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Represents Azure AD users who are at risk. Azure AD continually evaluates user risk based on various signals and machine learning. This API provides programmatic access to all at-risk users in your Azure AD.

For more information about risk events, see [Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-identityprotection/).
