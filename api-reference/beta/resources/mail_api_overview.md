# Use the Outlook mail REST API

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Microsoft Graph lets your app get authorized access to a user's Outlook mail data in a personal or organization account.
With the [appropriate delegated or application permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md), your app can access the mail data of
the signed-in user or any user in a tenant. The mail data can be in the cloud on Exchange Online as part of Office 365, or on
Exchange on-premises in a [hybrid deployment](../../../concepts/hybrid_rest_support.md).

## Using the mail REST API

Mail API requests are performed on behalf of a [user](../resources/user.md) which can be identified by the user's **id** property (a unique GUID), email address,
or the `me` shortcut alias for the signed-in user.

Email messages are represented by the [message](../resources/message.md) resource and organized in a [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md).
Messages and mail folders are identified by their **id** property, obtainable from `GET` operations.

> **Note:** In general, do not assume that **message** and **mailfolder** IDs are unique and immutable within a mailbox. They might change after certain
actions such as copy, move, or send.

Message bodies can be in HTML or text format.

You can use well-known folder names such as `Inbox`, `Drafts`, `SentItems`, or `DeletedItems` to identify certain mail folders that exist by default for all users. For a list of supported well-known folder names, see [mailFolder resource type](../resources/mailfolder.md).

For example, you can get messages in the Outlook **Sent Items** folder of the signed-in user, without first getting the folder ID:

```http
GET /me/mailFolders('SentItems')/messages?$select=sender,subject
```

## Common use cases

The **message** resource exposes properties such as **categories**, **conversationId**, **flag**, and **importance** that correspond to features
available in the UI, allowing apps to automate or integrate with the built-in Outlook user experience.

The Microsoft Graph API also provides methods and actions that support common use cases of messages.
