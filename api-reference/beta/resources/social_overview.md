# Use the Microsoft Graph API to integrate social intelligence in an app

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Microsoft Graph supports social gestures in a user's social context, and provides access to useful people and social data.

## Aggregate and extract specific information about people

Use the [person](../resources/person.md) resource and the People API to aggregate information
about a person from across mail, contacts, and social networks. The results are ordered by their
relevance based on multiple communication, collaboration, and business relationships. The API
lets you browse, sort, select, filter, or search for persons based on your criteria.

- [List people](../api/user_list_people.md)

## Manage @-Mentions

Calling out a recipient to notify and get the recipient's attention in a message is a common social gesture.
The [mention](../resources/mention.md) resource and the Mentions API provide a light-weight mechanism to call out
a recipient in a [message](../resources/message.md), get all the messages in which a user is notified using an @-mention,
or get each mention in a message.

Include the next sentence when supporting events.

**Mention** is also supported by [Event](../resources/event.md).
