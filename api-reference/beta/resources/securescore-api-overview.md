# Use the Secure Score API with Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph

 > **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. 

Microsoft 365 Secure Score is a new security analytics tool that applies a score to Microsoft 365 customers’ current Microsoft 365 security configuration. It helps organizations better understand their security posture and how to improve and reduce their risk in Microsoft 365. Secure Score helps customers balance their security and productivity needs with guidance to help them enable the right mix of the available security features and to model what their score would look like after adopting some of these features. Organizations can also compare their score with other organizations and see how their score has been trending over time.


## Why connect to Secure Score in the Intelligent Security Graph?

The Security API provides a unified gateway to connect to security solutions from Microsoft and partners. Queries are federated to all security providers in Microsoft Graph and responses are aggregated.
