# Use the Microsoft Graph Security API

 > **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

The Microsoft Graph Security API provides a unified interface and schema to integrate with security solutions from Microsoft and ecosystem partners. This empowers customers to streamline security operations and better defend against increasing cyber threats. The Microsoft Graph Security API can be used as a federated security aggregation service to submit queries to all onboarded security providers to get aggregated responses. Use Microsoft Graph Security API to build applications that:

- Consolidate and correlate security alerts from multiple sources
- Unlock contextual data to inform investigations
- Automate security operations for greater efficiency
- Provide visibility into security data to enable proactive risk management

The Microsoft Graph Security API includes the following key entities.

## Alerts

Alerts are potential security issues within a customer's tenant that Microsoft or partner security solutions have identified and are flagged for action or notification. With the Microsoft Graph Security [alerts](alert.md) entity, you can unify and streamline security  issues across all integrated solutions. This also enables applications to correlate alerts and context to improve threat protection and response. These unlock security operational efficiencies by reducing investigation time and time to resolution for incidents. With the alert update capability, you can sync the status of specific alerts across different security products and services that are integrated with the Microsoft Graph Security API by updating your [alerts](alert.md) entity.

Microsoft Graph Security-integrated solutions will receive alerts from the following security providers:

- Azure Security Center
- Azure Active Directory Identity Protection
- Azure Information Protection
- Microsoft Cloud Application Security
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection
- Microsoft Intune (private preview)
- Office 365 (coming soon)
- Partner solutions, such as Palo Alto Networks App Framework

> **Note:** New providers are continuously onboarding to the Microsoft Graph Security ecosystem.

## Secure Score (preview)

[Microsoft Secure Score](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Security-Privacy-and-Compliance/Office-365-Secure-Score-is-now-Microsoft-Secure-Score/ba-p/182358) is a security analytics solution that gives you visibility into your security portfolio and how to improve it. With a single score, you can better understand what you have done to reduce your risk in Microsoft solutions. You can also compare your score with other organizations and see how your score has been trending over time. The Microsoft Graph Security [secureScore](securescores.md) and [secureScoreControlProfiles](securescorecontrolprofiles.md) entities help you balance your organization's security and productivity needs while enabling the appropriate mix of security features. You can also project what your score would be after you adopt security features.
