# Use the security API to integrate with Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph

 > **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph is a unified platform for combatting cyberthreats. It powers real-time threat protection for Microsoft products and services and supports an ecosystem of integrated solutions.

The security API in Microsoft Graph makes it easy to connect with and extend Intelligent Security Graph. Use Microsoft Graph to build security solutions that consolidate and correlate security alerts from multiple sources, unlock contextual data to inform investigations, and automate security operations for greater efficiency.

## Why connect to the Intelligent Security Graph?

The security API provides a unified gateway to connect to security solutions from Microsoft and partners. Queries are federated to all security providers in Microsoft Graph and responses are aggregated.

### Unify and standardize alert management

Correlate alerts across security solutions more easily with a common alert schema. Write code once to integrate alerts from any Microsoft Graph integrated security solution, and keep alert status and assignments in sync across all solutions. You can also stream alerts to security information and event management (SIEM) solutions such as Splunk and IBM QRadar via [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitor-stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs#what-can-i-do-with-the-monitoring-data-being-sent-to-my-event-hub).

### Unlock security context to drive investigation

Dive deep into related security-relevant inventory (like users, hosts, and apps), then add organizational context from other Microsoft Graph providers (Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, Office 365) to bring business and security context together and improve threat response.

* [Python sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/python-security-rest-sample)
* [Node.js (JavaScript) sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/nodejs-security-sample)

Microsoft Graph security solutions will receive alerts from the following data providers:

* Azure Security Center (ASC)
* Azure Active Directory Identity Protection (AADIP)

## Authorization

The security API provides access to some of your organizationâ€™s most sensitive information. To better understand the types of authorization and how to manage them, we provide additional details in our Microsoft TechCommuity forums at the link below. 

[Understanding authorization when calling the Microsoft Graph Security API](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Using-Microsoft-Graph-Security/Authorization-and-Microsoft-Graph-Security-API/m-p/184376)

For more information about permissions, including delegated and application permissions, see [Permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

## Common use cases

The following are some of the most popular requests for working with the security API:

| **Use cases**   | **REST resources** | **Try it in Graph Explorer** |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| Get alerts | [Get alerts](../api/alert_list.md) | [https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/security/alerts](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?request=security/alerts&method=GET&version=beta&GraphUrl=https://graph.microsoft.com) |
| Update alerts | [Update alert](../api/alert_update.md) | `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/security/alerts/{alert-id}` |

<!-- (| Get security profiles | [Security profiles](../resources/securityprofiles.md) | [https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/security/hostSecurityProfiles](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?request=security/hostSecurityProfiles&method=GET&version=testSecurity&GraphUrl=https://graph.microsoft.com) | ) -->

## Next steps

The security API can open up new ways for you to engage with security solutions from Microsoft and partners. Follow these steps to get started:

* Drill down into [alerts](../resources/alert.md)<!-- and [security profiles](../resources/securityprofiles.md).-->
* Try the API in the [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer). Under **Sample Queries**, choose **show more samples** and set the Security category to **on**.
