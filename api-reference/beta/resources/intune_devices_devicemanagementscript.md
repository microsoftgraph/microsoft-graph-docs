> **Important:** APIs under the / beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) by the customer.

Intune will provide customer the ability to run their Powershell scripts on the enrolled windows 10 Azure Active Directory joined devices. The script can be run once or periodically.
