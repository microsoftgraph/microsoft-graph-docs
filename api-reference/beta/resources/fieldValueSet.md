# FieldValueSet resource

Represents the column values in a [listItem](listItem.md) resource.

## JSON representation

Here is a JSON representation of a **fieldValueSet** resource.
<!-- { "blockType": "resource", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.fieldValueSet",
       "keyProperty": "id", "openType": true } -->

```json
{
    "Author": "Brad Cleaver",
    "AuthorId": 13,
    "BookTitle": "Kangaroos and Wallabies: A Deep Dive",
    "PageCount": 350
}
```

## Properties

Each user-visible field in the **listItem** is returned as a name-value pair in the **fieldValueSet**.
The example above is for a list that contains three columns, **Author**, **BookTitle**, and **PageCount**.

Lookup fields (like `Author` above) are not returned by default.
Instead, the server returns an 'id' field (like `AuthorId` above) referencing the listItem targeted in the lookup.
The name of the 'id' field is the original field name followed by `Id`.

Up to 12 lookup fields may be requested in a single query.
The server will return lookup values if your request includes a `select` statement with the fields you need.
Example:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/sharepoint/sites/{site=id}/lists/{list-id}?expand=columnSet(select=Author,BookTitle,PageCount)
```

You may request up to 12 lookup fields in a single query, plus any number of regular fields.
