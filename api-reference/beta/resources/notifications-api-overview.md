# Use the notifications REST API in Microsoft Graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

You can use the notifications API in Microsoft Graph to send push notifications to a user. Simply target a user account to send a notification to, and the platform will deliver the notification to all device endpoints. Notifications API requests are performed on behalf of a user via [delegated permissions](/graph/permissions-reference#delegated-permissions-application-permissions-and-effective-permissions) and the [notification permission]( /graph/permissions_reference), which can be used with either Microsoft accounts or work or school accounts.
This type of user-centric notification is represented by the [notification](../resources/projectrome-notification.md) resource and is stored in Microsoft Graph. It can then be accessed and managed by the publishing app via the [client side SDK APIs](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-rome). 

## Next steps
- See the [notification resource](../resources/projectrome-notification.md) and create notifications to engage with your users. 
- Try the API in the [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).
- Get started with client integration, following the steps outlined in the [integration overview](/graph/notifications-integration-e2e-overview).
