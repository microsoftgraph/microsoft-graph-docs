# Shared resources in Microsoft Intune> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.These endpoints are used in multiple Microsoft Graph API for Intune workflows.  The intent, purpose, and permissions required to use a given resource varies according to the specific workflow and context of the underlying call.  In addition, certain methods, properties, and actions are supported only for specific workflows.The following Graph resources are shared between Intune workflows:- [Action state](intune-shared-actionstate.md)- [All devices assignment target](intune-shared-alldevicesassignmenttarget.md)- [All licensed users assignment target](intune-shared-alllicensedusersassignmenttarget.md)- [Compliance status](intune-shared-compliancestatus.md)- [Device and app management assignment target](intune-shared-deviceandappmanagementassignmenttarget.md)- [Device app management](intune-shared-deviceappmanagement.md)- [Device category](intune-shared-devicecategory.md)- [Device enrollment type](intune-shared-deviceenrollmenttype.md)- [Device management](intune-shared-devicemanagement.md)- [Device platform type](intune-shared-deviceplatformtype.md)- [Device type](intune-shared-devicetype.md)- [Enablement](intune-shared-enablement.md)- [Exclusion group assignment target](intune-shared-exclusiongroupassignmenttarget.md)- [Group assignment target](intune-shared-groupassignmenttarget.md)- [Install intent](intune-shared-installintent.md)- [IP range](intune-shared-iprange.md)- [IPv4 range](intune-shared-ipv4range.md)- [IPv6 range](intune-shared-ipv6range.md)- [Key/value pair](intune-shared-keyvaluepair.md)- [MIME content](intune-shared-mimecontent.md)- [Proxied domain](intune-shared-proxieddomain.md)- [Report](intune-shared-report.md)- [Report root](intune-shared-reportroot.md)- [Resultant app state](intune-shared-resultantappstate.md)- [RGB color](intune-shared-rgbcolor.md)- [Run as account type](intune-shared-runasaccounttype.md)- [Run state](intune-shared-runstate.md)- [Saved UI state generation options](intune-shared-saveduistategenerationoptions.md)- [URI](intune-shared-uri.md)- [User](intune-shared-user.md)- [VPP token account type](intune-shared-vpptokenaccounttype.md)- [VPP token action failure reason](intune-shared-vpptokenactionfailurereason.md)- [Windows domain join configuration](intune-shared-windowsdomainjoinconfiguration.md)
