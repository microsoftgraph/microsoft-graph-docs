# Yammer device usage reports

The Yammer device usage reports give you information about which devices your users are using Yammer on. You can view the number of daily users by device type, and number of users by device type. You can view both over a selected time period. You can also view details per user.

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** For details about different report views and names, see [Office 365 Reports - Yammer device usage](https://support.office.com/client/Yammer-device-usage-b793ffdd-effa-43d0-849a-b1ca2e899f38).
