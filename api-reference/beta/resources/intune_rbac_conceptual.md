# Role-based access control in Microsoft Intune> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.Intune's role-based access control determines who can perform actions on Intune objects and make changes for managed applications, users and devices.   The following Graph resources are available to manage role-based access control in Intune:- [Device and app management assigned role ids](intune-rbac-deviceandappmanagementassignedroleids.md)- [Device and app management role assignment](intune-rbac-deviceandappmanagementroleassignment.md)- [Device and app management role definition](intune-rbac-deviceandappmanagementroledefinition.md)- [Resource action](intune-rbac-resourceaction.md)- [Resource operation](intune-rbac-resourceoperation.md)- [Role assignment](intune-rbac-roleassignment.md)- [Role assignment scope type](intune-rbac-roleassignmentscopetype.md)- [Role definition](intune-rbac-roledefinition.md)- [Role permission](intune-rbac-rolepermission.md)- [Role scope tag](intune-rbac-rolescopetag.md)
