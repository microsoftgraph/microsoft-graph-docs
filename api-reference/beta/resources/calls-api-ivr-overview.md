# IVR scenarios in calls

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The following are the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) scenarios that the calling APIs in Microsoft Graph support:

- Playing an audio prompt - for example, when a call is placed in a customer service agent's queue.
- Record - for example, to record the caller's audio, usually after they heard a prompt with options.
- Subscribe to tone - for example, when you want to know what DTMF tones the caller selected, usually after hearing the audio prompt.
- Cancel Media Processing - for example, when you want to cancel any PlayPrompt or Record operations that might be in process.
