|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|orderHint|String|Used to set the relative order of tasks in the vertical on the task board view. Consider three tasks in the order of: `'O'`, `'P'`, `'Q'`. To move `'P'` to the top of the vertical, set its `'orderHint'` to smaller than that of `'O'`. The comparison is an ordinal string comparison.|
