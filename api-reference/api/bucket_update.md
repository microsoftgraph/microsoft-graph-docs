| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|name|String|Name of the bucket.|
|orderHint|String|Used to set the relative order of the buckets in the task board view. Consider three buckets in the order of: `'E'`, `'F'`, `'G'`. To make `'F'` the first bucket, set its `'orderHint'` to smaller than that of `'x'`. The comparison is an ordinal string comparison.|
