# Get a Class

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a class from the system. A class is a universal group with a special property that indicates to the system that the group is a class. Group members represent the students; group admins represent the teachers in the class. If you're using the delegated token, the user will only see classes in which they are members.
