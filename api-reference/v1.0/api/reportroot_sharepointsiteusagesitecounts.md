## Response

If successful, this method returns `302 Found` response redirecting to a pre-authenticated download URL for the report.

To download the contents of the file your application will need to follow the `Location` header in the response.
Many HTTP client libraries will automatically follow the 302 redirection and start downloading the file immediately.

Pre-authenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header to download.

The CSV file has the following headers for columns.

- Report Refresh Date
- Site Type
- Total
- Active
- Report Date
- Report Period
