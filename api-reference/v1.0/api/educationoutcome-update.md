## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /education/classes/acdefc6b-2dc6-4e71-b1e9-6d9810ab1793/assignments/cf6005fc-9e13-44a2-a6ac-a53322006454/submissions/d1bee293-d8bb-48d4-af3e-c8cb0e3c7fe7/outcomes/9c0f2850-ff8f-4fd6-b3ac-e23077b59141
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token} |

## Request body

In the request body, supply only the values of the fields you want to update.

Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

The educationOutcome object will be one of the following derived types: **educationPointsOutcome**, **educationFeedbackOutcome**, or **educationRubricOutcome**. Supply the specific properties relevant to the type of outcome being patched.

All derived outcome types have a regular and a "published" property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, **points** and **publishedPoints**, **feedback** and **publishedFeedback**. Don't update the "published" property; it is for internal use. For example, to assign points to an **educationPointsOutcome**, update the **points** property, but Don't update **publishedPoints**.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) object in the response body.
