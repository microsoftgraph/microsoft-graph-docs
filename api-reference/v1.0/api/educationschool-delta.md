## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

```http
GET /education/schools/delta
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description               |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this function returns a `200 OK` response code and a [educationSchool](../resources/educationschool.md) collection in the response body. The response also includes a `nextLink` URL or a `deltaLink` URL.

- If a `nextLink` URL is returned, there are additional pages of data to be retrieved in the session. The application continues making requests using the `nextLink` URL until a `deltaLink` URL is included in the response.
- If a `deltaLink` URL is returned, there is no more data about the existing state of the resource to be returned. Persist and use the `deltaLink` URL to learn about changes to the resource in the future.

For details, see [Using delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview). For example requests, see [Get incremental changes for users](/graph/delta-query-users).
