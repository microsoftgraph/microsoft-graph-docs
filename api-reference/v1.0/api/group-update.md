All other members of the group API, including updating  **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, support only delegated permissions. See [known issues](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/overview/release_notes#group-permission-scopes) for examples.
> - The rules for updating mail-enabled security groups in Microsoft Exchange Server can be complex; to learn more, see [Manage mail-enabled security groups in Exchange Server](/Exchange/recipients/mail-enabled-security-groups?view=exchserver-2019).
