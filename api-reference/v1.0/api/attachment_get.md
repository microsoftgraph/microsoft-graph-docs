# Get attachment

Read the properties and relationships of an attachment, attached to an [event](../resources/event.md), 
[message](../resources/message.md), or [post](../resources/post.md). 

An attachment can be one of the following types:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource)
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource)
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceAttachment.md) resource)

All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
resource. 

## Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API:

* If accessing attachments in messages: *Mail.Read*
* If accessing attachments in events: *Calendars.Read*
* If accessing attachments in group events or posts: *Group.Read.All*
