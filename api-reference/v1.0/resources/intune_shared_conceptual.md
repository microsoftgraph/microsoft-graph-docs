# Shared resources in Microsoft Intune> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.These endpoints are used in multiple Microsoft Graph API for Intune workflows.  The intent, purpose, and permissions required to use a given resource varies according to the specific workflow and context of the underlying call.  In addition, certain methods, properties, and actions are supported only for specific workflows.The following Graph resources are shared between Intune workflows:- [All devices assignment target](intune_shared_alldevicesassignmenttarget.md)- [All licensed users assignment target](intune_shared_alllicensedusersassignmenttarget.md)- [Device and app management assignment target](intune_shared_deviceandappmanagementassignmenttarget.md)- [Device app management](intune_shared_deviceappmanagement.md)- [Device category](intune_shared_devicecategory.md)- [Device management](intune_shared_devicemanagement.md)- [Exclusion group assignment target](intune_shared_exclusiongroupassignmenttarget.md)- [Group assignment target](intune_shared_groupassignmenttarget.md)- [MIME content](intune_shared_mimecontent.md)- [URI](intune_shared_uri.md)- [User](intune_shared_user.md)
