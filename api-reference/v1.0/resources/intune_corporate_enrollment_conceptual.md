# Enroll corporate-owned devices by using Intune> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.You can enroll organization-owned or corporate-owned devices to manage with Intune in a variety of ways, depending on the type of device, how the device was purchased, and the needs of the organization. You also can install the Company Portal app to enroll and manage corporate-owned devices, like in a "bring your own device" (BYOD) scenario.The following Graph resources are available to manage corporate-owned devices in Intune:- [All devices assignment target](intune_onboarding_alldevicesassignmenttarget.md)- [All licensed users assignment target](intune_onboarding_alllicensedusersassignmenttarget.md)- [Device and app management assignment target](intune_onboarding_deviceandappmanagementassignmenttarget.md)- [Device app management](intune_onboarding_deviceappmanagement.md)- [Device category](intune_onboarding_devicecategory.md)- [Device enrollment configuration](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentconfiguration.md)- [Device enrollment limit configuration](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentlimitconfiguration.md)- [Device enrollment platform restriction](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentplatformrestriction.md)- [Device enrollment platform restrictions configuration](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentplatformrestrictionsconfiguration.md)- [Device enrollment Windows Hello for business configuration](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentwindowshelloforbusinessconfiguration.md)- [Device management exchange connector](intune_onboarding_devicemanagementexchangeconnector.md)- [Device management partner](intune_onboarding_devicemanagementpartner.md)- [Device management](intune_onboarding_devicemanagement.md)- [Enrollment configuration assignment](intune_onboarding_enrollmentconfigurationassignment.md)- [Exclusion group assignment target](intune_onboarding_exclusiongroupassignmenttarget.md)- [Group assignment target](intune_onboarding_groupassignmenttarget.md)- [Intune brand](intune_onboarding_intunebrand.md)- [MIME content](intune_onboarding_mimecontent.md)- [Mobile threat defense connector](intune_onboarding_mobilethreatdefenseconnector.md)- [On-premises conditional access settings](intune_onboarding_onpremisesconditionalaccesssettings.md)- [Organization](intune_onboarding_organization.md)- [RGB color](intune_onboarding_rgbcolor.md)- [User](intune_onboarding_user.md)
