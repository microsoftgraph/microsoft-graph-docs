# Enroll corporate-owned devices by using Intune> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.You can enroll organization-owned or corporate-owned devices to manage with Intune in a variety of ways, depending on the type of device, how the device was purchased, and the needs of the organization. You also can install the Company Portal app to enroll and manage corporate-owned devices, like in a "bring your own device" (BYOD) scenario.The following Graph resources are available to manage corporate-owned devices in Intune:- [Device enrollment configuration](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentconfiguration.md)- [Device enrollment limit configuration](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentlimitconfiguration.md)- [Device enrollment platform restriction](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentplatformrestriction.md)- [Device enrollment platform restrictions configuration](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentplatformrestrictionsconfiguration.md)- [Device enrollment Windows Hello for business configuration](intune_onboarding_deviceenrollmentwindowshelloforbusinessconfiguration.md)- [Device management exchange connector status](intune_onboarding_devicemanagementexchangeconnectorstatus.md)- [Device management exchange connector sync type](intune_onboarding_devicemanagementexchangeconnectorsynctype.md)- [Device management exchange connector type](intune_onboarding_devicemanagementexchangeconnectortype.md)- [Device management exchange connector](intune_onboarding_devicemanagementexchangeconnector.md)- [Device management partner app type](intune_onboarding_devicemanagementpartnerapptype.md)- [Device management partner tenant state](intune_onboarding_devicemanagementpartnertenantstate.md)- [Device management partner](intune_onboarding_devicemanagementpartner.md)- [Enablement](intune_onboarding_enablement.md)- [Enrollment configuration assignment](intune_onboarding_enrollmentconfigurationassignment.md)- [Intune brand](intune_onboarding_intunebrand.md)- [MDM authority](intune_onboarding_mdmauthority.md)- [Mobile threat defense connector](intune_onboarding_mobilethreatdefenseconnector.md)- [Mobile threat partner tenant state](intune_onboarding_mobilethreatpartnertenantstate.md)- [On-premises conditional access settings](intune_onboarding_onpremisesconditionalaccesssettings.md)- [Organization](intune_onboarding_organization.md)- [RGB color](intune_onboarding_rgbcolor.md)- [VPP token account type](intune_onboarding_vpptokenaccounttype.md)- [VPP token state](intune_onboarding_vpptokenstate.md)- [VPP token sync status](intune_onboarding_vpptokensyncstatus.md)- [VPP token](intune_onboarding_vpptoken.md)- [Windows Hello for business pin usage](intune_onboarding_windowshelloforbusinesspinusage.md)
