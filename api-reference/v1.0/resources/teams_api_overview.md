# Use the Microsoft Graph API to work with Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is built on Office 365 groups. You can use the [group APIs](group.md) with teams, with the following exception: 

- Currently, you can't use [Create group](../api/group_post_groups.md) to create a team.  

>**Note:** If you use the group APIs in a [Microsoft Teams app](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams), rather than in a standalone app - for example as part of a tab or bot running in Microsoft Teams - follow the guidance in the article [Using Microsoft Graph in your Microsoft Teams pages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/graph).
